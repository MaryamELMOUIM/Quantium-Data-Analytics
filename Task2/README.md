# 🧪 Quantium Virtual Internship – Task 2: Experimentation & Uplift Testing

In Task 2 of the Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience, I took on a data experimentation project to evaluate the impact of **new trial layouts** in selected stores. The goal was to assess whether these changes led to a meaningful uplift in sales and recommend if the layout should be rolled out to all locations.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Compare performance in **trial** vs **control** stores to assess the effectiveness of a new in-store layout for the Chips category and provide data-backed recommendations.

---

## 📁 Project Steps

### 🧠 1. Control Store Selection
- Defined similarity metrics based on pre-trial sales, customer count, and transaction patterns.
- Built a function to identify control stores most similar to each trial store.
- Visualized and validated the match using correlation charts and trend comparisons.

### 📊 2. Trial Impact Assessment
- Compared sales and customer count of each trial store with its selected control during the trial period.
- Evaluated uplift in performance through:
  - Visual trend comparison
  - Statistical difference checks
  - Week-by-week impact measurement

### ✅ 3. Recommendation
- Summarized performance impact per store.
- Provided clear recommendations on whether the layout trial should be expanded based on results.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Statistical testing** for uplift validation
- **Jupyter Notebook** for code and analysis

---

## 📦 Deliverables
- Control store selection logic and visualizations
- Uplift analysis and insights per store
- Summary with recommendations and supporting visuals

---

## 📌 Outcome
This task strengthened my skills in experimentation design, statistical comparison, and communicating insights through visual storytelling. I learned how to validate the business impact of layout changes using data-driven methods.
