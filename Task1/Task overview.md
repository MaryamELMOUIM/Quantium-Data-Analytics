# 🛒 Quantium Virtual Internship – Task 1: Customer Analytics for Chips Category

Welcome to Task 1 of the Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience, where I took on the role of a junior data analyst in the retail analytics team. This project focuses on understanding customer purchasing behavior for the **Chips** category, to support strategic decision-making for the next half-year plan.

## 🎯 Objective

Analyze transaction and customer data to uncover insights about:
- Who is buying chips?
- How they shop (frequency, pack size, spend)?
- What segments are most valuable?

These insights are intended to support the **Category Manager** in optimizing strategy and targeting key customer segments.
